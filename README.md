# set_prompt
Set the prompt (PS1 variable) to what ever is needed at the time.

Most of the time a person would just use one prompt for the entire
terminal session. The point of this script is to be able to change
the prompt of a UNIX/Linux terminal to something more useful
depending on where the user is and what they are doing.

The different prompts will actually be stored in a dot file on the
user's home directory, and can be changed or expanded to fit the
user's needs. This script should not just set the PS1 variable from
a file, but also provide some tools to make the creation of prompts
easier.
